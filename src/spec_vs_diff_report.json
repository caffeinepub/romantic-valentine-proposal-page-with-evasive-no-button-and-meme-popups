  "summary": "REQ-12 appears partially addressed via new global CSS for a “Navera” highlight effect, but the diff snippet does not show the App.tsx headline change. REQ-13 is not fully implemented because no new romantic image asset was added, and the App.tsx update to reference it is not evidenced in the truncated diff. Several extra, unrequested changes (Tailwind theme tweaks, a placeholder hook file, and apparent No-button positioning logic changes) are present.",

      "id": "REQ-12",
      "requirement": "Update the main question headline in frontend/src/App.tsx to include the name \"Navera\" and add a clear, romantic highlight effect around the word \"Navera\" while preserving responsive layout and styling.",
      "reason": "A CSS class for highlighting Navera was added, but the provided truncated App.tsx excerpt does not include the main headline text, so inclusion of the name \"Navera\" in the headline and “only Navera highlighted” cannot be verified from the diff evidence.",

      "reason": "No new image file was added (Added: 0). The truncated App.tsx excerpt does not show the Good Choice modal image reference, so there is no evidence that the old asset was replaced or that the new specified filename/path is used.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\" (no new static asset added under frontend/public/assets/generated)",

      "description": "Changes (or additions) to No-button positioning logic (initial center-right positioning and “safe bounds” random movement).",
